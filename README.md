# Deep Learning REST API
Side project to create a REST API that incorporates Deep Learning (Keras+Tensorflow).

## Tutorial
This project is intended to follow the tutorial form [the official Keras blog](https://blog.keras.io/building-a-simple-keras-deep-learning-rest-api.html).

The project will be self-paced and some modifications will be performed to the original code in order to adapt it to the author's interests.
